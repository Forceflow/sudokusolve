# Sudokusolve
Sudokusolve is (yet another) Java-based sudoku solver with the following key features:

* **Logic**: Focusing on non-brute-force methods, following the same techniques as humans do.
* **Comprehensibility**: By using these techniques, the solver can provide accurate output about the solving process and the techniques used. Subsequently, a 'hint' process is also possible.
* **Portability**: Through the optimizing of the key solving algorithm, it can be applied in various other languages and environments.
